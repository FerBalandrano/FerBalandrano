## Hello, my name is Fer Balandrano, 
I am a Data Analyst and a Software Developer in training 😎 
I love analyzing data, mapping processes and requirements, and learning about Data Engineering, automation with AI, and everything about the tech world 🤖
I'm keen to learn more about data manipulation and visualization with different tools (currently PowerBi and Python libraries like Seaborn, Plotly, etc), ETL processes, workflow automation.

This GitHub Portfolio is a place where I plan to save my projects, to keep the lessons I learn, to showcase my skills and to connect with other people who may find my work interesting or whom I can learn from 🚀

Here are a couple of the projects I've been working on and I feel most proud about because they have allowed me to expand my skills outside my comfort zone:

### [SQL Data Warehouse with MySQL ](https://github.com/FerBalandrano/sql_data_warehouse_project)| Project based on SQL Server YouTube Tutorial (2026)
Developed the SQL code for a Data Warehouse implementation using the Medallion Architecture, adapting SQL Server concepts to MySQL to create various data processing layers.
Skills applied: Data modeling, SQL (DDL/DML), ETL processes, Data Dictionary.


### [Software Development Tools for Data Analysis](https://github.com/FerBalandrano/software_dev_tools_for_da_project) | TripleTen (2026)
Built and deployed a web service that generates basic visualizations from a dataset. The project involved using Python libraries, software development best practices, and GitHub, resulting in a cloud-based application for data exploration.
Skills applied: Python, Plotly, Streamlit, Version Control (Git), Application Deployment.
